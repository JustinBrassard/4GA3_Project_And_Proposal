#Upload data to github - done - michel
#Consolidate/trim data tables - we need to determine overlap between sign start date and collision date
#Reference the data sources in APA
#pertinent questions posed by Dr. Paez: do we have any idea where school zones end, precise locations of collisions?
#additional questions posed by Dr. Paez: does the speed limit of a school zone have an effect on collision event density; use k tests to evaluate the multi-scalar facets of our study
